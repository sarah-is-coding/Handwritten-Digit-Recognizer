# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

Train a model so that given a picture of a digit the model
will recognize the digit. Can use a neural network and/or regression. Create
a website and mobile app where someone can draw a number and the
model will predict and show what number it is most likely to be and its
confidence.

For training and testing the model, we will use python. For creating the two
UIs we plan to use Kivy to create a desktop application and then package it
for Android.
